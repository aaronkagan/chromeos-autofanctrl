# chromeos-autofanctrl
Chromeos cooling fan script, for chromebooks with fan speed problems
# Desciption
When my Asus Flip CX5 chromebook would get hot, it would spin up its fans. The problem was that the fans wouldnt turn off when the chromebook was cool again, so they would be at 60% speed, while the cpu was idle. This script resets the fans every 5 seconds, so they will function as intended. 
# Installation
1. Chromebook must be in developer mode *dev mode link*
